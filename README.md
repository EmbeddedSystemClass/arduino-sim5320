# Sim5320 Driver for Arduino



*This library was inspired by Adafruit_FONA library. I wanted to make one that could be used just like an Ethernet/EthernetClient or WiFi/WiFiClient library. The device used for testing is actually a Adafruit-Fona-3g. I realise this device is not the most popular for developpement and I couldn't find the SIM5320 device on digikey. I might make one for some UBlox products eventually.

Do not hesitate to give me your feedbacks, I could use some.
